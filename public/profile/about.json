  "about": "I am a versatile developer driven by data, logic, and clean architecture. My core expertise lies in backend development, data analytics, and full-stack engineering — where I love designing systems that are both efficient and intelligent. With hands-on experience in Python, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and SQL, I enjoy building products that seamlessly combine functionality with data insights.\n\nI’m deeply interested in solving complex backend challenges, optimizing databases, and integrating data pipelines that power real-time applications. At the same time, I explore machine learning models and analytical dashboards that turn raw information into meaningful decisions.\n\nMy long-term goal is to become a well-rounded engineer capable of bridging backend systems with data intelligence — crafting scalable, data-driven solutions that truly make an impact.",
